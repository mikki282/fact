Looping Concept
and conditional statement concept

#while loop

echo "enter number"

read n

fact=1

while [ $n -gt 1 ]

do

fact=`expr $n \* $fact`

n=$(($n-1))

done

echo "Factorial is: $fact"



#for loop

#this will print number from 1 to 50 in interval of 5.

for var1 in {1..50..5}

do

echo " $var1 "

done



#for loop using list of value

i=1

for day in Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri

do 

echo " weekdays $((i++)) :" $day

done



#for loop using C like syntax

echo "enter value"

read n

sum=0

for (( i=0; i<=n; ++i ))

do

sum=`expr $sum + $i`

done

echo "Sum is :"$sum



#for loop with command

echo "all file list"

for val in $(ls)

do

echo " $val "

done



#for loop for file

echo "content of file"

for val2 in `cat main.sh`

do

echo"$val2"

done



#Conditional statement

#if statement

echo "enter first value "

read a

echo "enter second value"

read b

if [ $a -gt $b ]

then

   echo "$a is greater than $b"

fi





#elif and else condition

echo "enter first value "

read a

echo "enter second value"

read b

if [ $a -gt $b ]

then

   echo "$a is greater than $b"

elif [ $a -lt $b ]

then

    echo "$a is less than $b"

else

   echo "result not found"

fi



#Case statement



vehicle=$1

echo "enter name"

read vehicle



case $vehicle in

  "car")

     echo "rent of $vehicle is 100 dollar";;

  "van")

     echo "rent of $vehicle is 70 dollar";;

"truck")

     echo "rent of $vehicle is 80 dollar";;

"bike")

     echo "rent of $vehicle is 60 dollar";;

*)

  echo "item not listed";;
